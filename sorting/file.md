# type of sorting algo

## sorting 
   ### space user 
            inplace 
            out of place
   ### stablitiy
            stable 
            unstable 

    

   ### space use 
        it's not requist any kind of space for sorting algo
        [70,10,80,30,20,40,60]

   ### stablie 
        if sorting algo ater sorting the contes does not change the "sequence of similar" content in which they appear 

        [1,2,3, 4 ,5]
        [1,2,40,5,40]
        

        [1,2,5,40,40]  == > stable sorting algorithum 

        eg : insertion sorting


        simple mearning : in sorted list it's not change the index that mean 40 vlaue still before the prevous 40 value 
    
   ### unstable 
        if a sorting algotihm after sorting the content changes  the sequence of similar content is which they apper then its called unstable sort 


        [1,2,3, 4 ,5]
        [1,2,40,5,40]
        
        [1,2,5,40,40]  == > stable sorting algorithum 

        eg : queick sorting
